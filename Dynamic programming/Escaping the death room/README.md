Your friend is trapped in an N*N room at square (x,y). He can make K moves to try and escape. Each move is one of R possible moves. In any trial, if he escapes he canâ€™t get back inside the room. Calculate how many scenarios he succeeds in escaping. The first 10 test cases can pass using brute force. Use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.



==> Input Format


One line containing N, K, R, x, and y separated by a space.

For R lines:

dx, dy, The move he can make.

* Constraints


0 <= N <= 70

0 <= K <= 100

0 <= R <= 10

0 <= x,y <= N-1

-(N/2) <= dx,dy <= (N/2)

The test cases are guaranteed to fit in an unsigned long long

==> Output Format


One line containing the number of scenarios in which he escapes.


Sample Input 0


2 2 2 0 0

1 1

-1 -1

Sample Output 0


2

Explanation 0


If he makes move 1 twice or makes move 2 once he escapes, if he makes move 1 then make move 2 he stays inside. He succeeds twice and fails once.
